Welcome to QCGWAData's documentation!
=====================================

On these pages you can find the necessary documentation to run ``QCGWA.py``, a python module to quality control your GWA output files.

A QC of GWA data in general involves two steps: (1) format checking and curation if needed and (2) QC based on preset properties, e.g. a MAF filter. These two steps are performed by ``QCGWAData.py`` and the user will receive information in log and summary files. In addition, the QC run can be inspected afterwards by looking at the outputted graphs.
