Here's what I did to end up with the background gene data sets:
- Use file "UniqGeneSymbols.txt" for upload in next step;
- Use webgestalt (db versions in "WebGestalt (WEB-based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit).html") to get background gene list;
- Download annotated list => "UniqGeneSymbols.txt_1386949612.txt_complete_info_results.txt";
- Run "FilterUniqGeneSymbols.txt_1386949612.txt_complete_info_results.sh" => "NULLFilteredUniqEntrezIds.txt" for later use in KOBAS2.0;
-
